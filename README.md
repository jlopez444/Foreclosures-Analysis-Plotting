# Rental-Analysis-Plotting
In this project, we are using HvPlot (geomaps) to visualize Rental Properties in the Los Angeles area!  We read in multiple CSV files that contain information on the Rentals and the lenders that hold the titles to the home.  After extracting the "Lender" data, we use HvPlots to visualize the data.  We are able to search the properties by lender,by property type and by council ditsrict. Enjoy!
